# HeapPriorityQueue
A Max-Heap priority queue coded in Java with all the basic methods and 2 bonus ones, one for removing item with a specific ID (in the examples, heap input are cities and they have a field named ID)  with worst case complexity O(1) and one for inserting and dynamically keeping k items in the heap all the time with worst case complexity O(k) (Third semester). Project also contains class City and program clients for heapsort (without the use of the Heap), dynamic managment of k cities and finding of the median using the keys (which is the CovidCasesDensity in our examples). The cities text file is an example input.
